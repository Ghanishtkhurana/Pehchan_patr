      <p>
        Hello! {"I'm"} a dedicated and passionate Full Stack Web Developer with over
        a year of experience in building dynamic and responsive websites and
        applications. Currently, Iâ€™m honing my skills at Veblika, where I
        specialize in developing robust CRM systems and engaging websites using
        the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey in web development started from a genuine curiosity about how
        things work on the internet, which soon evolved into a deep-seated
        passion for creating efficient and user-friendly digital solutions. With
        a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I
        strive to build seamless and interactive web experiences that meet the
        unique needs of each client.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Veblika, {"I've"} had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects,
        from crafting intuitive user interfaces to designing scalable
        server-side applications. My role involves not just writing code, but
        also collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to deliver
        high-quality products that drive business success.
